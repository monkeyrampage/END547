# END547
Class project
This is the class project for the END-547 course: Business Intelligence & Machine Learning Applications.

Paper used for the project: Multiclass classification of dry beans using computer vision and machine learning techniques
that belong to: the Dry Bean Dataset. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C50S4B.

4 different supervised ML technique has been used in the paper. We will be replicating and see if we can improve these results and also add some unsupervised methods on top of that.
